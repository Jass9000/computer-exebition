Introduction:-
Arav:Good Morning Principal ma'am,Vice principal ma'am,Teachers and all my fellow mates.
Arav:My name is Arav.
Devang: I am Devang.
Zaid:And I am Zaid
Arav:With the help of our operators at the back end Daksh. We have made the game K.B.C taking the inspiration from one of
India's Famous show Kaun Banega Crorepati. KBC is a game in which you have to answer the questions,and climb up the prize ladder
but wait a second there is a twist that you will win absolutely no money.
Devang:Because we are not sponsored by Adani or Ambani
Arav:So, play for fun, not for funds!"
Zaid: "This code runs the game with questions, options, and lifelines like 50-50 which removes two incorrect answer, Phone-a-Friend which gives you mostly correct answer but can be wrong also like your decisions sometimes, and Skip which is used to jump to the next question. Answer correctly, and you’ll hear claps. If you get it wrong, well, the game gently shows you the door—but with style!"
Devang: "Oh, and there’s a robot voice that reads out the questions, like a low-budget Amitabh Bachchan. It’s here to make sure you feel like you’re in the hot seat."
Arav: "The questions start easy, then get harder. We even added some random fun, like your friend giving you the wrong answer on the Phone-a-Friend lifeline. Classic, right?"
Zaid: "So, sharpen your brains and get ready to play. Just remember—no crores, only cheers! Enjoy the game, learn something new, and laugh along the way."
Arav:Now we request our operator to display the program.
Devang: "Let’s start! The real prize is proving how smart you are. And hey, no pressure—because we can’t afford any!"
