Introduction:-
Arav:Good Morning Principal ma'am,Vice principal ma'am,Teachers and all my fellow mates.
Arav:My name is Arav.
Devang:And I am Devang.
Arav:With the help of our operators at the back end Daksh and Zaid We have made the game K.B.C taking the inspiration from one of
India's Famous show Kaun Banega Crorepati. KBC is a game in which you have to answer the questions,and climb up the prize ladder
but wait a second there is a twist that you will win absolutely no money.
Devang:Because we are not sponsored by Adani or Ambani.
Arav:You get lifelines like 50-50 which removes 2 incorrect answers, "Phone a Friend" mostly gives correct answer but can be wrong
, "Skip" to jump on to the next question and "give up" not a life line but is used to give up like our hopes after the exams.
Arav:Now we request our operator to display the program.
